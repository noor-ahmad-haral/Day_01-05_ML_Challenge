🔍 **Algorithm Overview:**

Linear Regression is a fundamental technique in statistics and machine learning, designed to model and analyze relationships between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (features). Our goal is to predict the target variable using a linear equation, finding the best-fit line (or hyperplane) that minimizes prediction errors.

### 11. Results Visualization 📉
Visualize the actual vs predicted prices to understand the model's performance.

## 📝 Results

### 📉 Mean Squared Error (MSE)
The notebook computes and prints the MSE.

### 📈 R-Squared (R²)
The notebook computes and prints the R² value.

## 📊 Visualizations

### 🔍 Price vs Area
A scatter plot showing the relationship between price and area, with points colored by the number of bedrooms.

### 🔮 Actual vs Predicted Prices
A scatter plot comparing actual prices to predicted prices, showing how well the model performs.

## 🏁 Conclusion

The notebook successfully implements a linear regression model to predict house prices based on their square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms. The results are evaluated using MSE and R², and visualizations are provided to understand the model's performance.
